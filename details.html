      <h2>From Atlanta to Everywhere</h2>
      <p>September 13, 1996 holds weight in hip-hop history — the day we lost Tupac Shakur, but also the day Jordan Terrell Carter was born in Riverdale, Georgia. The world would come to know him as <strong>Playboi Carti</strong>, a genre-bending artist who helped rewrite the rules of rap.</p>
      <p>Carti began rapping under the name $ir Cartier in 2011, later changing it as his SoundCloud loosies like <strong>Broke Boi</strong> and <strong>Fetti</strong> became underground anthems. He built a name in Atlanta’s scene before relocating to New York, linking with A$AP Mob, and signing to Interscope — entering the Cash Carti era.</p>
      <p>With a voice that floated between whisper and chant, and a look blending goth, punk, and high fashion, Carti became more than a rapper. His 2017 debut mixtape and 2018’s <strong>Die Lit</strong> made waves, but his mysterious silence afterward only deepened his cult status. When he returned in 2020 with <strong>Whole Lotta Red</strong>, he emerged fully reborn as Vamp Carti — chaotic, raw, post-genre.</p>
      <p>In 2019, he founded <strong>Opium</strong>, a label and collective pushing a new wave of experimental artists like Ken Carson and Destroy Lonely. Then, in 2025, he released his third studio album, <strong>Music (I Am Music)</strong> — proving once again that Carti doesn’t follow trends. He is the trend.</p>
      <p>More than music, Carti is energy. A symbol of rebellion, fashion, and youth subculture — forever evolving, never explaining.</p>
